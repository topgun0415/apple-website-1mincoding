## ðŸ’« About project

Apple Interactive Website Course

## ðŸ’« Purpose of Project

- Learn Apple's new scroll interactive website
- Improve JS Canvas, Animation skills

</br>
This course was for intermediate level developers who  understand Javascript's canvas & animation deeply. Literally, It was really hard course for me even though I studied Javascript deeply. So I was busy to catch up with courses. Interactive Website need to know well about operation of javascript with maths knowledge too. But there is nothing to worry about! Time will solve this problem. when some MERN stacks courses finish, I will try this course someday again ðŸ¤£
